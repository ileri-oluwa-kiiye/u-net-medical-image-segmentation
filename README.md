# U-Net for Medical Image SegmentationðŸ©»

This repository contains an implementation of the U-Net architecture for medical image segmentation tasks. U-Net is widely used in biomedical image analysis, especially for segmenting organs, tumors, and other medical features from scans such as MRI and CT.

##  Project Structure
- `u-net-for-medical-image-segmentation.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook implementing and training the U-Net model.
- `README.md`: Project overview.

## Model Architecture
The U-Net is a convolutional neural network designed for fast and precise segmentation of images. It consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization.
